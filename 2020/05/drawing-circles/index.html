                        <p>Embedded programming, microcontrollers and FPGAs have always been
incredibly appealing to me. Why? Probably because they emphasize
things about development and design that I personally believe to be
very important - keeping things short, efficient and simple.</p>
<p>Recently, I needed to draw circles with as little code as possible
which always get me into the &ldquo;is there a better way&rdquo; mode. The
traditional approach would be simply to use the</p>
<p><img src="/img/circles-eq0.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>equation and if the squared coordinates sum up to the squared radius,
the point lies on the circle. Yet, to calculate y from an arbitrary x,
you need multiplication and square roots - things not exactly trivial
in the world of simple tiny chips.</p>
<h2 id="minskys-circle-algorithm">Minsky&rsquo;s Circle Algorithm</h2>
<p>There is a cool solution to this problem called the Minsky&rsquo;s circle
algorithm. The algorithm was stumbled upon in 1960s and is incredibly
simple.</p>
<p><img src="/img/circles-eq1.svg" alt=""><br>
<img src="/img/circles-eq2.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Original idea was using the old value of x to draw a spiral shape, but
the programmer made a mistake and used the new value of x - the output
was, mysteriously, a circle. If you use the new value of x, then the
expression becomes</p>
<p><img src="/img/circles-eq1.svg" alt=""><br>
<img src="/img/circles-eq3.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>It resembles a rotation matrix</p>
<p><img src="/img/rotation_matrix.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>because for small angles <em>cos</em> is close to 1 and <em>sin</em> is close to 0:</p>
<p><img src="/img/circles-eq4.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant">determinant</a> is
equal to 1, there is no scaling and the curve ends up being closed
after a number of iterations.  Instead of multiplying by an arbitrary,
small number ε, we multiply by a negative power of two which is
essentially equal as dividing by a power of two. This is approximated
using right shifts (2^-4 is chosen for this example).  The expression
now becomes really simple:</p>
<p><img src="/img/circles-eq5.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Bit shifts are very efficient, and in ASIC/FPGA world they can even be
free (if implemented through wire routing). This provides a good
result, but not entirely accurate. Is there a way that&rsquo;s just as
simple, yet more accurate?</p>
<h2 id="improvement">Improvement</h2>
<p>A more recent approach by Neal and Pitteway (1990) substantially improved
the accuracy. Minsky&rsquo;s algorithms actually produces an ellipse tilted
at 45 degrees that highly resembles a circle. Distance to the circle
varies, so to compensate they introduce a second ellipse perpendicular
to the original one, and perform half rotation against each of them.</p>
<p><img src="/img/circles-eq6.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This reduces maximal distance from the actual circle by several orders
of magnitude.</p>
<h2 id="can-we-do-even-better">Can we do even better?</h2>
<p>Accuracy is already way better than any specifications required, but
the fun is in trying to make it even better. Let&rsquo;s take this idea
further with something like:</p>
<p><img src="/img/circles-eq8.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Keeping two pairs of coordinates does slightly increase the memory and
computational load, but sticking to bit shifts and additions retains
the benefits provided by the original algorithm. If a large radius
(2^32) is used and ε set to 2^-12, max distance from a true circle in
this particular case is &lt; 14, which is only a few nanometers to a
meter.  Still not exact, but accurate enough for most practical
applications one could think of.</p>
<p>This also provides accurate trig functions - simply put the decimal
point before the MSB bit and treat the rest as sin (y) and cos (x)
values. Handy!</p>
<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>
<p>Errors - the distances from the exact circle for the three methods are
plotted and log scale is used to compensate for them being very far
apart.  Original method (blue) caps around 10^6, second one (red)
around 10^3 and the third (green) around 10^1. And who said math isn&rsquo;t
amazing, fun and useful?</p>

incredibly appealing to me. Why? Probably because they emphasize
things about development and design that I personally believe to be
very important - keeping things short, efficient and simple.</p><p>Recently, I needed to draw circles with as little code as possible
which always get me into the &ldquo;is there a better way&rdquo; mode. The
traditional approach would be simply to use the</p><p><img src=/img/circles-eq0.svg alt></p><p>equation and if the squared coordinates sum up to the squared radius,
the point lies on the circle. Yet, to calculate y from an arbitrary x,
you need multiplication and square roots - things not exactly trivial
in the world of simple tiny chips.</p><h2 id=minskys-circle-algorithm>Minsky&rsquo;s Circle Algorithm</h2><p>There is a cool solution to this problem called the Minsky&rsquo;s circle
algorithm. The algorithm was stumbled upon in 1960s and is incredibly
simple.</p><p><img src=/img/circles-eq1.svg alt><br><img src=/img/circles-eq2.svg alt></p><p>Original idea was using the old value of x to draw a spiral shape, but
the programmer made a mistake and used the new value of x - the output
was, mysteriously, a circle. If you use the new value of x, then the
expression becomes</p><p><img src=/img/circles-eq1.svg alt><br><img src=/img/circles-eq3.svg alt></p><p>It resembles a rotation matrix</p><p><img src=/img/rotation_matrix.svg alt></p><p>because for small angles <em>cos</em> is close to 1 and <em>sin</em> is close to 0:</p><p><img src=/img/circles-eq4.svg alt></p><p>Since its <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant>determinant</a> is
equal to 1, there is no scaling and the curve ends up being closed
after a number of iterations. Instead of multiplying by an arbitrary,
small number ε, we multiply by a negative power of two which is
essentially equal as dividing by a power of two. This is approximated
using right shifts (2^-4 is chosen for this example). The expression
now becomes really simple:</p><p><img src=/img/circles-eq5.svg alt></p><p>Bit shifts are very efficient, and in ASIC/FPGA world they can even be
free (if implemented through wire routing). This provides a good
result, but not entirely accurate. Is there a way that&rsquo;s just as
simple, yet more accurate?</p><h2 id=improvement>Improvement</h2><p>A more recent approach by Neal and Pitteway (1990) substantially improved
the accuracy. Minsky&rsquo;s algorithms actually produces an ellipse tilted
at 45 degrees that highly resembles a circle. Distance to the circle
varies, so to compensate they introduce a second ellipse perpendicular
to the original one, and perform half rotation against each of them.</p><p><img src=/img/circles-eq6.svg alt></p><p>This reduces maximal distance from the actual circle by several orders
of magnitude.</p><h2 id=can-we-do-even-better>Can we do even better?</h2><p>Accuracy is already way better than any specifications required, but
the fun is in trying to make it even better. Let&rsquo;s take this idea
further with something like:</p><p><img src=/img/circles-eq8.svg alt></p><p>Keeping two pairs of coordinates does slightly increase the memory and
computational load, but sticking to bit shifts and additions retains
the benefits provided by the original algorithm. If a large radius
(2^32) is used and ε set to 2^-12, max distance from a true circle in
this particular case is &lt; 14, which is only a few nanometers to a
meter. Still not exact, but accurate enough for most practical
applications one could think of.</p><p>This also provides accurate trig functions - simply put the decimal
point before the MSB bit and treat the rest as sin (y) and cos (x)
values. Handy!</p><h2 id=comparison>Comparison</h2><p>Errors - the distances from the exact circle for the three methods are
plotted and log scale is used to compensate for them being very far
apart. Original method (blue) caps around 10^6, second one (red)
around 10^3 and the third (green) around 10^1. And who said math isn&rsquo;t
amazing, fun and useful?</p><figure><img src=/img/error_plot_logscale.png width=800></figure></div></section><h1 class=content-subhead>03 Dec 2015, 11:47</h1><section class=post><header class=post-header><a href=https://blog.hrvoje.org/2015/12/the-eagle-has-landed/ class=post-title>The Eagle Has Landed</a><p class=post-meta></p></header><div class=post-description><p><img src="/img/orao-emulator-small.png?style=rightimg" alt></p><p>The year was 1984. Apple Macintosh was just introduced, as well as our own
shiny new computer called &ldquo;Orao&rdquo; (Eagle). It ended up being chosen as a
standard primary school computer in Croatia from 1985 to 1991. For many of us,
kids back then, this was one of the first opportunities to ever use a computer.
Simple and rudimentary by today&rsquo;s standards, Orao was brilliantly designed to
avoid using specialized components - only simple TTL logic and off-the-shelf
parts were used.</p><p>I wanted to write a cross-platform emulator, and after making one in Python,
decided to go a step further and port it to Javascript. This is perhaps the
most convenient way to use it, even though not all features were ported. To
invoke BASIC, enter &ldquo;BC&rdquo; after booting. It can fetch one of the available tape
images as .wav files via AJAX and load them. Loading takes time, computers
were slow back then. :-)</p><p>For a slightly more complete version, check the
<a href=https://github.com/hrvach/OraoPy>Python version</a>, but if you just want a
quick dose of nostalgia - <a href=http://orao.hrvoje.org>HERE</a> it is!</p><p>TL;DR: enter BC at the * (star) prompt, press ENTER when asked about the memory
size and try one of the following:</p><pre><code>LMEM &quot;SPACEINV&quot;
LMEM &quot;CRVIC&quot;
LMEM &quot;MUZIKA&quot;
LMEM &quot;DEMO2&quot;
LMEM &quot;RUSENJE&quot;

So, you might ask: &ldquo;What are golf missions?!&rdquo;. The idea is to solve the problem using as little code as theoretically possible. Your score is inversely related to code length and transforms a mildly challenging problem into a very addictive one.</p><p>One of the most interesting missions is called <a href=www.checkio.org/mission/ghost-detect/>Ghost Detect</a>. It might not seem special at first, but it gets tricky as solutions get shorter. The mission goal is to write the shortest possible code to recognize if three consecutive signals sent in binary are of the same length. 11000001100011 is a good signal while 111000100011 is a bad one. There is at least one zero between every group of ones. For each character used (less than 200) you earn 1 point. So, how do we do this?</p><h4 id=1-use-regex-77-characters-123-points>1.

Split on zeros, convert to sets, remove empty set to avoid messing with the count and check if less than two.</p><h3 id=now-what>Now what?</h3><p>To further shorten it, we need to try a different approach - binary.
In binary, when you multiply by 2, you shift all the bits one position
to the left. So, for example, 00010 multiplied by 2 becomes 00100. A
valid signal, according to the task, is a number with three groups of
ones equally long with zeros inbetween. This actually means it&rsquo;s made
of a number multiplied by a power of two, then the same number was
multiplied by some other power of two and added, and then the same
number was added again. For example, 111000111000111 is actually
<img src=/img/d9a80334debf2785aba1a4753d3d35da.svg alt></p><p>Therefore, we can write a generalized form for such a number n being equal to</p><p><img src="/img/1b6db3065d555d4a9700385ab2960ddc.svg?style=centerimg" alt>
<img src="/img/5e5e9d7474621935430829ddfce71f15.svg?style=centerimg" alt></p><p>The number should, then, be divisible by both k and r without reminder. First variant that comes to mind is to test if n divided by k equals r. But we have neither k nor r, and the only thing we have to work with is the number given to our function. We have to think of a way to get the number using bit manipulation.</p><pre><code>n       = 111000111000111
n+1     = 111000111001000
------------------------- XOR
n^n+1   = 000000000001111
n       = 111000111000111 
------------------------- AND
n&amp;n^n+1 = 000000000000111
</code></pre><p>So, now we have k with some bit tricks expressed like n AND n XOR n+1. To find r, we divide n by k and realize it&rsquo;s basically the original number with sequences of ones reduced to a single 1. We can achieve this too with a little bit manipulation.</p><pre><code>n       =  111000111000111
n*2     = 1110001110001110
-------------------------- AND
n&amp;n*2   =  110000110000110
n       =  111000111000111
-------------------------- XOR
2*n&amp;n^n =    1000001000001
